## Description

Stella/Satellite level table is a curation of well-made BMS charts grouped by Easy Gauge Clear levels. Charts may have different perceived levels on different gauges or different goals (e.g., Full Combo). The original table provides estimated levels for each gauge clear and full combo for each song on [Satellite](https://stellabms.xyz/recommend/sl) and [Stella](https://stellabms.xyz/recommend/st).

This derivative table tries to put the data in a form consumable by BMS players like Beatoraja and LR2. Currently, the table is tested on Beatoraja; LR2 has not yet been tested.

For each gauge type, songs are sorted on their estimated levels and grouped into 50-sized buckets.
